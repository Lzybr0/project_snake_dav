This is a simple project which I have done in my 1st semester using C programming language.
It is based on linux and uses vim as a editor software. 
This is a simple snake game which has 5 main features (i.e Start, Difficulty, Score board, Help & Quit).
After running the code at the beginning u have to enter your name which will be displayed in the scoreboard section with your score and diffculty mode.
